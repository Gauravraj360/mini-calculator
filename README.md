I want to know more about positioning in CSS as I was very confusing while positioning my layout and I want to work on my responsiveness of my web-ppages.


### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I want to give credit to frontend mentors that give me this challange although it was a beginner's challange but I am beginner and want to learn everything step by steps.
and I also refer to some documentation of mdn docs and w3school and I think documentation is the best help when you don't have any one to help.
